Description: This package facilitates the use of BayesDiallel for
    analyzing treatment-response experiments in a diallel cross. This sort of design
    may come up in mock-controlled infection studies or placebo-controlled drug
    studies. An optimal method for determining the treatment effect is dependent
    on the study design and data structure, and this package and associated scripts
    implements an imputation and matching method for estimating 
    treatment effects using a causal inference framework. Static link
    to related manuscript data, scripts, and package are available at: http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.293015.
