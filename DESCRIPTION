Description: This package facilitates the use of BayesDiallel for
    analyzing treatment-response experiments in a diallel cross. This sort of design
    may come up in mock-controlled infection studies or placebo-controlled drug
    studies. The method for determining the treatment effect is heavily dependent
    on the study design and data structure, and this package and associated scripts
    largely implements a matched-quartets method for estimating 
    treatment effects using a causal inference framework. Static link
